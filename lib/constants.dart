    "Hey, can you grade this narrative essay?\n'We did it! We sent a message..,' Beckham said as he sprang out of his chair, swiftly strode across our chemistry lab table, and gave me a firm handshake and hug. The ecstatic feeling was mutual. Two teenagers had just used a light like Bluetooth. Those words were enough to keep the project alive, with only 72 hours to go before the sub-county science fair competition. \nIt was the 2019 August holiday. I had just arrived home from boarding school. My face could not hide its weariness and the disappointment written all over it from a loss at the young scientist Kenya competition. To escape reality, I decided to watch TV. I opened the Discovery Family Channel and watched one of my most intriguing programs, ‘Nasa Unexplained files’ . I would then watch a show where they unravel the unusual observance of mysterious lasers in space. Could they be weapons? Or are the aliens trying to contact us? In the end, it was a way a Nasa space rover would efficiently transmit data using light (lasers) instead of radio waves. That was my introduction to Light Fidelity (LIFI).\nLight Fidelity was a new technology by 2019, almost eight years. Its whole concept was using visible light to transmit data or provide internet instead of Radio waves with speeds up to 250 GBPS. For the next three months, I would deep dive into the internet and scour for ways of making LIFI and present it in the next science fair competitions.\nDespite its lack of publicity, presenting a direct copy of LiFi from the internet was a terrible idea, and I knew it. So I took a detour. Rather than creating an internet medium, I would use the concept of LiFi for chemical qualitative and quantitative analysis. A chemical analysis inspired by the failure of my environmental project at the National Young Scientist Kenya competition 2019. A project that analyzes the amount of fluoride in water used by people, how it affects the intelligence and health of the people using it, and develop a simple local inexpensive way of improving the water quality.\nIt started with the realization that a third of the students in the school fraternity had brown-colored teeth. Why? We did a questionnaire to samples of students and tallied the color of their teeth according to their geographical home location. The results showed distinction in the percentages of students with brown teeth. We then tried to find out the mineral composition of the water used in those geographical locations. They showed a variation in the quantitative amount of fluoride in the water. Students from Bisil, who mainly used borehole water, had 55% of them having brown teeth comprising 21% of all the students with brown teeth. Students from Oloitoktok, who used Mt. Kilimanjaro glacial waters, had 10% of them having brown teeth comprising less than 1% of all the students with brown teeth. We calculated the average GPA of sampled students per their geographical location. Students from Bisil had a lower GPA than those from Oloitoktok.\nSince bones are effective absorbents of fluoride by remineralization, we design a simple filter using bone ash. The study of fluoride was not part of the school curriculum. To prove we removed fluoride, we developed a qualitative precipitation method. Even after being runners-up in the sub-county science fair, being eliminated in the Kajiado county science fair, and winning a medal at the Young scientist Kenya competition, the method was still faulty.\nLight bends differently in different optical densities. Chemical elements reflect light at different frequencies. Using these concepts, we hypothesized that we could use light to determine the chemical content of water. If we could send a known frequency of light through the water containing known mineral ions, observe the frequency change. Repeat it over with different known minerals. We could perform a qualitative analysis of chemical substances by passing light through them. That was our science fair project.\nAfter several failures, 72 hours before the competition, Beckham and I would go to the chemistry lab and try again for the last time. We would reconnect the Arduino circuit to the laptops as we think of all we left behind. I would remember the school basketball position that I gave up to participate in the science fair and the class secretary pending responsibilities. There was no turning back. With my little coding experience, I would alter the Arduino code again and pray. But this time was the last time we failed.\nWe would then go to the sub-county science fair. Be the first in the computer science position, proceed to the county science fair, and win the most innovative science project award.'";
